# Machine Learning (CS-GY6923) Final Project

This repository and project was developed for the CS-GY-6923 Machine Learning class at NYU. The class professor is Linda Sellie. 

The author of the project is [Justin Snider](https://github.com/aobject/). 

## Introduction

This project implements three extensions to machine learning strategies covered in the class. For each extension we demonstrate how the strategy can be implemented using the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Then, we will implement the strategy using only Numpy [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). 

## Required Setup

1. Run the 'setup.py' Python script in the repository root folder. 
   * This will do the following:
     * Create a 'data/' directory
     * Download the CIFAR-10 dataset
     * Unpack the CIFAR-10 dataset
     * Delete the tar file. 
2. Install the correct required libraries.
3. Set all notebooks as trusted. Most of the data visualization are interactive and created with Bokeh. If you do not set the notebook as trusted you will not see the interactive visualizations. 

## Directories

Extension-1/		

* The directory containing the Convolutional Neural Network extension. 

Extension-2/

* The directory containing the Pooling and ReLu extension. 

Extension-3/

* The directory containing the Skip Link Deep Neural Network extension.
