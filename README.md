# Machine Learning (CS-GY6923) Final Project

This repository and project was developed for the CS-GY-6923 Machine Learning class at NYU. The class professor is Linda Sellie. 



The author of the project is [Justin Snider](https://github.com/aobject/). 

## Introduction

This project implements three extensions to machine learning strategies covered in the class. For each extension we demonstrate how the strategy can be implemented using the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Then, we will implement the strategy without using only Numpy. 



## Extension 01 // Neural Network CNN

### Machine Learning Algorithm: Neural Networks

* Select a machine learning algorithm implemented in a homework assignment

### Scikit-learn Implementation: Convolutional Neural Networks

### Scikit-learn Extension: 

### Our Implementation: 

* Implement this extension by adding code to your homework assignment implementation. (Note: It is okay if our implementation does not get the same improvement Scikit-learn does. If this is the case we explain why we did not get the same performance )

### Compare Original and Extension on New Dataset: 

* Select a new dataset of your choice and show this data set's accuracy using your homework assignment implementation, and with the new extension you just added. 





## Extension 02 // Neural Networks Dropout

* Select a machine learning algorithm implemented in a homework assignment

### Machine Learning Algorithm: Neural Networks

* Learn how to use Scikit-learn's implementation (make sure parameters in Scikit are set to match the parameters in the homework assignment). Then, find an extension of the basic algorithm that Scikit-learn implements that improves accuracy on one of the datasets we used for our assignment. (Example would be adding lasso regularization to logistic regression)

### Machine Learning Algorithm: Neural Networks 

* Select a machine learning algorithm implemented in a homework assignment
